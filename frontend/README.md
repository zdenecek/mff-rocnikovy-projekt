# frontend

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

## Notes
When running in dev environment, on two different ports, don't forget to include the frontend domain (including port, eg. localhost:8080) in the backend's CORS whitelist. Otherwise, the backend will reject the requests from the frontend (see SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS).




### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
